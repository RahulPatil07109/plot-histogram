## About

Developed a frontend in Reactjs , which does the following:

1. On first load, only has a Submit button

2. On clicking on Submit, it will fetch the contents of terriblytinytales.com/test.txt

3. Parse the content and find the frequency of occurrence of each word (some words will occur only once, some twice and so on, and some will occur N times)

4. Then on the frontend, plot a histogram of the 20 most occurring words.

X-axis = top 20 words with highest occurrence
Y-axis = how many times they occurred in the file 

# Installation
1. Libraries to make chart `npm i Chart.js react-chartjs-2` 

## To start an existing React website, you will need to follow these steps:

   1. Clone the website's code from its repository onto your local machine. This can usually be done using a version control system like Git.

   2. Install all of the necessary dependencies for the website. This can usually be done by running npm install or yarn install in the directory where the website's code is located.

   3. Start the development server for the website. This can usually be done by running npm start or yarn start in the directory where the website's code is located. This will start a local development server, which you can use to view and test the website in your web browser.
